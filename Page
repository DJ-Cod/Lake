  <p> You take a dip in the pool and you feel full mountains of pleasure. As you rest, time feels like it's stretching out, and a few seconds feels like minutes, as you get more and more tranquill. </p>
  <p> But then you notice something. Why did you coem here? </p>
  <p> The thought peers at you, and you cannot rember anything that happened before you were in this cave. You just appeared.</p>
  <p> As you get welled up in this thought, you let your gaurd down, and before you know it, you see an animal standing before you in a defensive stance.</p>
  <p> You cannot make out what animal it is, but you know it is gearing up for a fight. </p>
